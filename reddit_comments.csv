If Chiefs B team played another B team today it would be a close game. 

These guys on the Chiefs want to show they belong on the roster but guess FUCKING WHAT? The B team is playing against a good A TEAM in Broncos. This why back ups exist they simply ARENT GOOD. You really think if the Chiefs tried with this B team they would topple the Broncos and their elite defense? 

I‚Äôll speak for all 32 teams in the league that not one B team roster could go into an away game against any A team roster and win. 

Quit ya bitching, don‚Äôt blame the Chiefs. Your defense is a liability. You lost to Jacoby Brisset and the Patriots. To be a top team in the league you need to beat top teams. You lost 8 games the Bengals aren‚Äôt good.
