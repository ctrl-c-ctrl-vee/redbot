**Free Kick Fair Catch and Fair Catch Kick**

In rare situations, the fair catch can be used to set up a fair catch kick. If a team catches a kickoff or free kick with a fair catch, they have the option to attempt a field goal from the spot of the catch without a snap. This kick is treated similarly to a kickoff, meaning the defense cannot block it, and the offense must kick from a stationary position.

The kick must be either a place kick or a drop kick, and if it passes over the crossbar and between the goalposts of the opposing team's goal, a field goal, worth three points, is awarded to the kicking team",1,t1_m2xavox,1734662542,0

Also, a player who doesn't receive the snap does not receive the ""outside the tackle box/past the LOS"" protection on potential intentional grounding. So if Saquon Barkley takes a handoff on a halfback pass, if he chucks it out of bounds, it's a penalty. This even applies to the original QB on a flea-flicker.",1,t1_m2xejaf,1734664086,0
